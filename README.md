# Fundus Web app

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Important

If want to set up on server, need to change "localhost" to your server ip address, in "Controller.js" and "http-common.js". If not so, the axios won't work.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
